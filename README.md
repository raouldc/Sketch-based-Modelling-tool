Sketch-based-Modelling-tool
===========================

A sketch-based modelling tool that creates a surface-of-revolution from a sketched curve, using Catmull-Rom Splines

##Sketching a profile curve:
Press the right mouse button and moving the mouse. The curve needs to lie on the left 
side of the blue rotation axis . If you press “s” the 
surface-of-revolution is computed.

Note that after pressing the ‘s’ key you get into “surface mode” and you can rotate the surface by 
pressing the left mouse buttonand moving the mouse. You can get back to the sketch mode by 
pressing “r” (reset) two times.
